This site was designed to help me to understand and code HTML5, CSS and Git. During this challenge I was tasked with refactoring existing code to bring it up to a more accessible standard. While updating the site I found a broken link in the code that was fixed as well as several images that did not contain alt tags for accessibility that I also corrected.While examining the site I noticed that on smaller view screens, the text in several of the containers would break out past the visual boundaries designed for the content so I took some time to fix this issue and ultimately made the site much more consistent across smaller and larger view screens.I learned the importance of clean code and while updating the site was able to remove a number of duplicate css rules. Overall this was a fun project and really helped sharpen my skills as a developer.
